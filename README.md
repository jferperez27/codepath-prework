Prework for CodePath IOS Development

App Brainstorming

Facebook
- Customizability of personal profile
- Ability to reach out instantaneously to anyone / look anyone up

TikTok
- Endless algorithm allows for no time limit for content / time spent on app
- Very simple to learn how to use, not many features makes the app less intimidating to learn to use

An idea I have for an IOS application would be creating an app that facilitates inter-college participation. For example, colleges are known to be social hotspots for students in their respective college, yet how do we branch out this idea of sociality to other schools? How do we cross the barrier of social events to include a variety of colleges, especially those who reside in close locations from one another or during major sports events regarding multiple colleges? I believe an app that creates a social context for inter-college events to foster the social environment of college students outside of a students prospective alma mater would corroborate the idea of sportsmanship while also increasing the social aspect of college and facilitate the overall social experience for other college students.
